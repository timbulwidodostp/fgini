This program computes a GINI coefficient from an arbitrary data series using Mata.

	   Assumes x as been sorted in ascending order. 
	   Why don't I assert the data are sorted? The program should be fast and
	   we call to sort before calling this function. 
	   I adapted the algorithm from here:
	   http://freerangestats.info/blog/2017/08/05/weighted-gini
	   which is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0
	   It references a working paper "Working Paper No 17â€“02 by Vic Duoba and Nairn MacGibbon"
	   at https://www.stats.govt.nz/methods/research-papers/working-papers-original/calc-gini-index-17-02.aspx
	   which is a dead link. Google Scholar searches do not turn up the working paper
	   
	   This algorithim is O(n) once the data are sorted by x and the sort is O(n log n)
	   compared to other algorithms that are O(n^2)
