{pstd}
{cmd:fgini} computes the Gini coefficient of {it:varname}. While the Gini is defined
as a function of all pariwise combinations of values in {it:varname}, the algorithim used
in {cmd:fgini} scales in complexity approximately linearly with the number of observations.

{pstd}
The algorithim used in {cmd:fgini} was adapted from {browse "http://freerangestats.info/blog/2017/08/05/weighted-gini":freerangestats.info/blog/2017/08/05/weighted-gini}, 
which appears to follow {it:Accurate calculation of a Gini index using SAS and R} by Vic Duoba and Nairn MacGibbon at
